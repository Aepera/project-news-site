# News Site

The aim of this project was to build a news/magazine website, using Flexbox technique to create the structure and responsiveness to viewport sizes.

## The problem

I used Flexbox to build the structure and layout of the website. 
Since the site should be responsive, I started with coding for mobile view and then added media queries for tablet and desktop sizes. 

If I had more time I would have added a drop down menu in the mobile view. I would also have made the "Big news" section a bit larger.
